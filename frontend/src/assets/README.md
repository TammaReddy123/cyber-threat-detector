# Assets Folder

This folder contains static assets for the frontend application, such as:

- Globe textures (e.g., earth.jpg for the base texture)
- Country boundary data (e.g., countries.geojson)
- Other 3D models or images used in the visualization

Place your asset files here and reference them in the components as needed.
